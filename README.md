# Language for Music (LFM), Midterm Edition
Group: Christopher Isidro, Spencer Lafferty, Justin Lee, Patrick Polcuch

Project Description: 

Our group aims to make a language that specializes in music creation and analysis. We intend to use the placement of blocks to represent sound in order to make music creation more accessible to those not musically trained. This programming language will assist in writing sheet music, and creating music compositions.  A sound library will be utilized to allow the programmer to switch between instruments while adding their respective notes to the sheet.  Some smaller ideas the group has for this language are having booleans that analyze your current music and determine whether some notes harmonize or clash.  On top of this you will be able to set time signatures so the language can determine where to place your notes.


Our project will use the prinicples of parsing, interpretation and compilation. Our language will parse the sound blocks and the formatting blocks in order to construct music. Once the blocks have been parsed, we will interpret the sounds and compile them into a sound file that can be played back.
