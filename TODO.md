* ~~put link to repo page in github pages "View Source on GitHub"~~
* ~~We should also format the links in the annotations.md to have hyper-links instead of plain text links~~
* Create a function playSong(), that accepts a song object. This function will eventually play the audio for the song, but we dont need to impliment that yet
* Have the blocks converted into objects of type note, measure, and song.
* For the generate code section, show the code that converts the blocks into objects and then show the call for playSong(Song object).
* log what you do in log.md on the github
* maybe create a "Save Code" button that downloads code with .js extension. Our code isnt complete so I dont know if it would make sense to do this quite yet. If we dont do it we should explain why somewhere.
* Use SampleAudioPlayer.js from the milestone1 folder to play the melody.
